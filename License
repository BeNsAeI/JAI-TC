In plain english:
I don't claim JAI-TC is good for anything 
- If you think it is, great, but it's up to you to decide.
- If JAI-TC doesn't work: tough.
- If you lose a million because JAI-TC messes up, it's you that's out of the million, not me.
- If you don't like this disclaimer: tough. I reserve the right to do the absolute minimum provided by law, up to and including nothing.
- Do not distribute JAI-TC for profit! (seriously!).
- This is basically the same disclaimer that comes with all software packages. Download and use this tool at your own risk and responsibility.

Note 1: this software installs packages that are not produced by me. I put a lot of effort making sure that the licenses for those tools are provided to the user correctly. If despite my effort there are any issues with licensing please reach out to me at Saeedib@oregonstate.edu.
Note 2: You are about to install git and lynx via APT. By continueing you agree to terms and conditions of those tools.
